## Components

This application has three main components:

    App: This is the main component that holds the CardQuote component.
    
    CardQuote: This is the component that holds the state for the quote, background color, and image.

    Quote: This component displays the current quote and author.

    Button: This component displays a button that, when clicked, generates a new quote, background color, and image.

## Hooks

This application uses the following React hooks:

    useState: This hook is used to store the current quote, background color, and image.

    useEffect: This hook is used to fetch a new quote from the API when the application first loads and whenever the "New Quote" button is clicked.

    useRef: This hook is used to reference the quoteContainer div so that we can capture a screenshot of the quote to share on Twitter.

## API
